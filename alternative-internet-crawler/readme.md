| Askemos | A fast and trustworthy foundation on which to build applications: Byzantine fault-tolerant P2P computation and storage.[Askemos](http://askemos.org) creates an "autonomous virtual execution environment for applications" - designed to be tamper-proof and fault tolerant.

| BaseParadigm | [BaseParadigm](https://bitbucket.org/travisfw/baseparadigm/) is anopen source (GPLv3) library for managing a content addressable binarysemantic graph.

BaseParadigm lays the basis for a new paradigm fordata management that can be done offline as much as is desirable, andputs control over data storage, transmission, and processing back inthe hands of the user. Identity management becomes data managementrather than what it is today: contract management with third party webservices.
