        "description": "The project Windows Mobile OLSR Demon created by the Moviquity company and based on studies funded within the European project Workpad, offers a free source code under license GPL v3 with which any developer will be able to deploy a MANET (AD-HOC Network, Meshnet) with protocol OLSR. The project has been developed for Windows Mobile 6, Windows XP and can be adapted to other platforms that have the NET Framework or Compact Framework with some restrictions. \n\nThe project developed completely by Moviquity in C# is mostly compatible with the olsr.org project . The initial project is shaped by a beta version for daemon OLSR libraries and a beta version of an emulator OLSR. \n\nLike free code, it is open to modifications that will be welcomes for the continuity of the project.",
