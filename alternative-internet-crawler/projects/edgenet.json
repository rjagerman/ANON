It's suited to decentralized chat and proximity networking.", "tags": ["p2p", "peer", "network"], "ohloh_analysis": "19104213", "total_code_lines": "0", "ohloh_description": "The idea is to create a network of users for sharing data.  Instead of serving data from the backbone/trunk, data is served from the edge/leaves.  There are also to be measure in place to protect the identity/integrity of peers, as well as the entire network.  There will be very little central authority involved, probably only used in pointing new peers to a connection point on the network. \n\nThis will NOT be a p2p client, but a backbone on which to build more applications.  We are working to provide software that will connect to the network, then interface with applications to take advantage of it.", "updated_at": "2014-03-13T00:16:36Z", "min_month": "2008-03-01T00:00:00Z", "total_commit_count": "3", "ohloh_id": "51049", "name": "edgenet", "total_contributor_count": "2", "twelve_month_contributor_count": "0", "factoids": ["Short source control history", "Stable Y-O-Y development activity", "No recent development activity"], "twelve_month_commit_count": "0"}
