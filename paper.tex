	\IEEEPARstart{W}{ith} the introduction and commercialization of the internet in 1995, it has become an important tool for anyone to freely and easily communicate. In many cases however, internet usage is either censored or monitored by third parties. In recent years the need for anonymous internet communication has become more apparent. Revealing government wrongdoings, such as in the case of WikiLeaks, or the ability to communicate freely in a censored environment are two major examples of why anonymous communication is important.
	
	Although much research has been done about anonymous internet communication, only few systems have been actually implemented and used in practice. One of the most important factors that impact anonymity in a communication system is the number of users. A sufficiently large numbers of users are required for the system to make guarantees about its ability to conceal and hide users' communication. This makes it difficult to introduce a new anonymous internet system, due to the initial lack of users. Another important factor is for the system to be decentralized. Whenever a network has centralized components and a malicious third party gains control over these components, the functionality and perhaps even the anonymity of the system is compromised.
	
	The most widely used anonymous communication system is TOR. In this paper we will analyze TOR and its semi centralized nature. Furthermore we will look at attempts that have been made to decentralize TOR as well as several other decentralized systems.
	
	This paper is structured as following: In section \ref{sec:tor} we will give an introduction and overview about Tor. After that we will talk about decentralization and its problems in section \ref{sec:problems}. Vulnerabilities in Tor are discussed in section \ref{sec:attacks}. Afterwards, we will discuss the current state of decentralized internet systems in section \ref{sec:decentralized}. A comparison of existing decentralized networks is made in section \ref{sec:comparison}. Finally we will conclude and discuss our findings in section \ref{sec:conclusion}.
	
\section{Introduction to Tor}
	\label{sec:tor}
	The implementation of The Onion Router was first described by the U.S. Navy Research Laboratory, as means to protect government communications from digital, as well as physical attacks, by hiding the location of the communicating party or parties \cite{goldschlag1996hiding}.

	In 2002, it was decided to ditch the old code base and reimplement the project as Tor, the Second Generation Onion Router, introducing perfect forward secrecy, directory servers, hidden services and more \cite{dingledine2004tor}.
		
	\subsection{Onion routing}
		As described in the original design paper of The Onion Router, network traffic is forwarded through a circuit of nodes, where each node only knows the previous and next node in the circuit. With a sufficiently long circuit of (independent) nodes, this means that two communicating parties can remain oblivious of each others physical location.
					
		Say we have a circuit consisting of four nodes: our trusted client node ($C$), an (entry) relay node ($X$), a (middle) relay node ($Y$) and an exit node ($Z$). In this case, there are two relay nodes, but this is not a fixed number (and could be increased for more security). Each node has its own public key and a corresponding private key. When building the circuit, our client generates a distinct secret for each of these nodes.
					
		The payload of each packet flowing through the circuit is first encrypted with the distinct secret for last node $Z$, then with the distinct secret for node $Y$, and last with the secret for node $X$. With each layer of encryption, a header is added with the address of the next node in the circuit, plus the used distinct secret encrypted with corresponding nodes public key. 
					
		After node $X$ receives this packet from out trusted node $C$, it decrypts the attached secret with its private key, and uses that secret to decrypt the rest of the packet. The result is a header with the address for node $Y$ and the payload encrypted with secrets for the following nodes in the circuit, which is forwarded to node $Y$.
					
		As a node receives a packet from the previous node, it peels off another layer of encryption, much as how you can peel an onion layer for layer, and forwards it to the next node in the circuit (as specified in the decrypted header). When exit node $Z$ decrypts the last layer, it forwards the unencrypted payload outside the network to the original destination that our trusted client $C$ tried to contact, acting as a traditional proxy.
					
		When exit node $Z$ receives a response, this whole process is applied in reverse order, encrypting the payload with its secret along the way, instead of decrypting. When our client $C$ receives the packet, it peels off all the encryption layers to retrieve the unencrypted payload.
		
		With the second generation onion routing used in Tor, a modified algorithm is used to derive the encryption keys, called \emph{telescoping path-building}, which also provides perfect forward secrecy. This algorithm is described in section \ref{ss:tor_circuit}.
				
	\subsection{Directory servers}
		The original Onion Router implementation used in-band status updates where each node broadcasts know nodes to its neighbours. An attacker could exploit this to isolate and limit the knowledge of a client, forcing connections through malicious nodes. Beside possible security disadvantages, in-band status updates also have the disadvantage that it takes longer to propagate throughout the network and create a global consensus.
					
		To mitigate these concerns, Directory Servers were introduced to Tor during its reimplementation to keep a redundant central consensus about the network. They act as HTTP servers to which Tor nodes can publish signed information about themselves. Tor clients can in turn download this information.
					
		This information is signed by the Directory Servers before it is distributed to the Tor clients. The keys to verify these signatures are preloaded in the Tor software, along with the list of Directory Servers, which implies trust by the Tor client in the Directory Servers.

	\subsection{Relay and exit nodes}
		The Tor network consists of several components. The clients in the Tor network are known as Onion Proxies. The software to run an Onion Proxy is available for free on the Tor website \cite{torprojectwebsite} and is easy to configure. The Onion Proxies are responsible for downloading the directory information, establish circuits across the network and handle connections from user applications.
		
		The routing in the network is done by Onion Routers, also called relay nodes. The relay nodes relays the data from the Onion Proxy to the web server across a circuit (circuits are described in 2D). Each Onion Router is connected to every other Onion Router with a TLS connection \cite{tlsprotocol}. Each circuit has three type of Onion Routers \cite{mccoy2008shining}:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item{The entrance Tor router:} this router is directly connected to an Onion Proxy and can observe the origin of a request through the Tor network. The entrance router sends the packet to the middle Tor router.
			\item{The middle Tor router:} this router is connected to the entrance router and the exit router.
			\item{The exit Tor router:} this router is connected to the web server. Note that the exit Tor router is the only router that can observe the final destination of the request.
		\end{itemize}
		
		The first router in a circuit is the entrance router. The entrance router sends the data to one of the middle router which forwards the data to the exit router.
			
	\subsection{Circuit creation}
		\label{ss:tor_circuit}
		As described in the previous section, data on the Tor networks travels over circuits. The data travels over the circuit in fixed-size cells that are 512 bytes long. Each cell has a header and a payload. The header consists of a number that identifies the circuit of the cell and a command that indicates what to do with the cell’s payload.
		
		Before a circuit can be established, a path has to be chosen. The current path selection algorithm in Tor selects nodes based on the bandwidth of the nodes [link naar cacr2011-20]. Nodes that have more bandwidth, have a higher probability to be chosen for the circuit setup, however, the same node can't be used more than once in a circuit.
		
		Suppose Alice is an Onion Proxy that wants to connect through the Tor network to a web server. Circuit setup uses the Diffie-Hellman key-exchange protocol \cite{diffiehellman} to establish a shared secret between nodes. To create a new circuit, Alice first sends a \emph{create} cell with the first half of the Diffie-Hellman handshake ($ g^b $) to the first node in her selected path (for example, OR1). OR1 sends a \emph{created} cell back with the second half of the key ($ g^b $) along with a hash of the final key. Now both Alice and OR1 have a shared key they use to encrypt and decrypt data between them.
		
		So now Alice has a connection with the first Onion Router in the circuit. To extend the circuit to OR2, Alice first sends a \emph{relay extend} cell to OR1. This cell contains the address of the next Onion Router in the circuit and the first half of the key to use in the communication between her and OR2 ($ g^{a_2} $). OR1 takes this first half of the key and sends a \emph{create} cell with this key to OR2. When OR1 receives a created cell, OR1 passes this cell to Alice. Now Alice and OR2 share a common key: $ K = g^{a_2b_2} $. The same procedure can be used to extend the circuit with more nodes.
			
	\subsection{Disadvantages}
	\label{ss:tor_disadvantages}

		While Tor guarantees anonymity, there are some disadvantages using it. The main disadvantage is that the Tor network is slow. According to the Tor Metrics project [link naar tor metrics project], it takes about 6 seconds to download 1 MiB of data.
		
		According to Dingledine et al \cite{dingledine2009performance}, there are six reasons why Tor is not optimal. In this section, we will summarize these reasons and explain what could be done to fix them.
		
		First of all, the congestion control does not work well. The network has some problems handling bulk transfers, such as when downloading large files or streaming high-quality videos. The congestion control could be improved by using an unreliable protocol for links between Tor relays.		
		
		Some Tor users put more traffic on the network than they contribute by running a Onion Router. This means that these users are slowing the network down as they use more traffic than giving to the network. A possible solution for this is to throttle certain protocols at exit nodes or at Onion Proxies.
		
		Also, the Tor network doesn't have the capacity to handle all the users that want privacy on the Internet. By increasing the amount of Onion Routing in the Tor network, the capacity is increased. Incentives such as LIRA \cite{jansen13lira} could make more users run a Onion Router, thus increasing the capacity of the network.		
		
		The current path selection algorithm of Tor doesn't distribute the load evenly over the network. The problem is that the current selection strategy is optimal when the network is fully loaded. Using a better path selection algorithm could increase the capacity of the network and the overall user experience.		
		
		Another problem is that the Tor clients are not optimal at handling latency and connection failures. For example, if extending a circuit fails, the entire circuit is abandoned. An improvement would be to first try to extend the circuit to some other places. If that fails, the circuit could be abandoned. Also, a better timeout mechanism could be chosen for building circuits.		
		
		Much of the overhead of the network is in downloading the directory information. There is also overhead in the TLS connection between the nodes in the network. Removing the empty TLS application record which could reduce the overhead in the TCP/IP header with 6.3\%.
		
	\section{Tor vulnerabilities and attacks}
Besides the disadvantages mentioned in the previous section, Tor also suffers from several vulnerabilities that can be exploited trough attacks \cite{abbott2007browser, douceur2002sybil, bauer2007low}. In this section we will summarize some of the most well known problems with Tor as well as define the following categories of attacks: Browser based attacks, Low-Resource Routing attacks, Sybil attacks and Replay attacks.

		\subsection{Browser based attacks}
		Traffic analysis can be used to attack the anonymity of a user (a Tor client) browsing the web using Tor \cite{abbott2007browser}. By misusing the exit policy of Tor one can reduce the time required to perform the analysis.\\

		By running a HTTP exit node and an Tor router that eventually will act as an entry node in the network, an adversary can discover the identity of a user. The exit node injects an invisible iframe containing some JavaScript into the web pages that pass by, each sending a unique ID to a malicious web server. Every ten minutes the Tor client chooses a new circuit and eventually an unlucky Tor client picks and uses the malicious entry node that was placed in the network.\\

		By performing traffic analysis to compare the unique IDs of the web server and the circuits passing trough the entry node, a user can be identified via matches. A similar system can be set up only using the HTML meta refresh tag. To increase the odds of a user choosing the malicious exit node, one can run the exit node on unpopular ports. There are usually only a few exit nodes running on file sharing ports 4661 to 4666.\\

		The solution for the JavaScript injection attack is disabling active content systems in the browser. For the HTML only variant one would have to use HTTPS to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks.

		As we saw, the directory service generates overhead of the network. If we could replace this central authority, we could reduce the overhead of the network and improve the performance. This means, we would like to have Tor decentralized. Many research has been done already on the decentralization of Tor [linkjezz] but so far, no anonymous, well-performing decentralized network has come up. This is due to the fact that there are many problems decentralization brings along with.

\section{Problems when decentralizing}
		As we saw in the previous section, we would like to have a decentralized anonymous network. This isn't an easy task: 15 years of decentralization attempts on the Tor network are behind us. Several well-used decentralized peer-to-peer overlay networks are active such as Gnutella [link], Freenet [link] and Tapestry. These networks will be described in more detail in the next chapter. Among these networks are some overlay anonymous networks such as Tarzan.

		There are advantages when using a centralized authority: this authority can be used for bootstrapping, key management and to manage the reputation of the users. When removing this central authority, these components needs to be spread across the peers in the network. In this section we will explain the various problems that are involved when decentralizing Tor. In the next section, we will explain several decentralized peer-to-peer networks and make a comparison between them.
		
			\subsection{Bootstrapping new nodes}
		If a Tor user decides to donate some of his bandwidth by running a bridge or a relay and thus creating a new node in the network, there has to be one starting point where this new node can discover neighbors in the network to connect with. In Tor a directory server can tell the new node what his neighbors are and how to find them \cite{dingledine2004tor}.\\
		
Moving this system to a non peer-to-peer base is difficult. Dingledine et al. stated that this indeed is still an open problem. With decentralized systems there is no central directory server to tell a new node where to locate neighbors and there might be a lot of malicious nodes in the network. Some systems such as Tarzan, MorphMix and Pastry \cite{rowstron2001pastry, rennhard2002introducing} do have made some attempts towards a decentralized system, but have yet to find the final answer.

		\subsection{Incentives in decentralized systems}
		As described in section \ref{ss:tor_disadvantages} people are using more bandwidth than that they donate. There are multiple proposals \cite{dingledine2010building, jansen13lira} to introduce incentives into Tor. If one would also have to build an incentive system into a decentralized system, they would have to find a way to manage the ratings of each client in the network, in such a way that they cannot be falsely modified. In other words the incentive data has to be accurate and reliable. Besides the integrity of the data, also the traffic it generates on the network should have minimal impact.\\
		
		Rahman \cite{rahman2009survey} proposes several options to build in incentives in a peer-to-peer network. The first thing that is described is the so called \emph{Warm-glow Model}. In this model determines the percentage of free-rides based on the probabilistic population distribution. If the percentage is above a certain threshold, the system will show signs of diminishing marginal returns.\\
		
		The second proposal is using monetary schemes. While it is not exemplified a lot, the main idea is to use a virtual currency as incentive. The problems with this approach are the scalability and the hidden costs of this service.\\
		
		The third proposal is \emph{Reciprocity-Based Schemes}. Using this approach a peer maintains a behavior history of other peers in the network. These schemes can be based on two somewhat reciprocities: direct reciprocity or indirect reciprocity. The formal are more suitable for longer relationships between peers. The latter is more scalable but they rely on third party and must handle trust issues themselves.

		\subsection{Key exchange}
		When using a decentralized network, using a centralized authority for managing the keys, is not possible. This means that for secure communication, peers have to exchange the keys directly with each other, without a trusted party between them. Diffie-Hellman is a very popular algorithm for exchanging keys between two parties. Diffie-Hellman is for example used in the circuit setup in Onion Routing (see chapter I), however, it is possible for an adversary to manipulate with the keys send between two parties. This makes it possible for the adversary to decrypt all message sent between the two parties.

		Tor currently uses an interactive forward-secret key-exchange protocol called the Tor authentication protocol (TAP) [linkje naar ace]. This protocol uses telescoping which means that the initiator negotiates session keys with each successive hop in the circuit. There are several proposals for more efficient key exchange methods. One of them is ACE, an one-way authenticated key exchange protocol. The authors of this methods claim to have an 46\% efficiency improvement on the side of the client and an efficiency improvement of nearly 19\% on the side of the Onion Routers. ACE requires clients to send one extra element but that doesn't introduce any overhead because this element fits in the unused space in a cell.

	\section{Current decentralized systems}
		Many other decentralized peer-to-peer networks have been proposed and some have been implemented [linkjes naar papers]. Examples of fully decentralized networks are Gnutella, Freenet, Freehaven, Tapestry, Kademlia and Tarzan. Each of these decentralized networks will be discussed in the next section. Note that we're only considering fully decentralized networks here. Networks that are partially or hybrid centralized, such as KaZaA and Napster, are not discussed here.[link naar survey p2p?]
	
		\subsection{Gnutella}
			Gnutella is a decentralized peer-to-peer network used for distributed search of files. Since the network is fully decentralized, peers in the network are called 'servents', a combination of the words servers and clients. Each peer can act both as a server, answering queries, or as a client, requesting and executing search queries. In order for a client to bootstrap, a new peer connects to one of several known hosts that are almost always available. These peers can be found on http://gnutellahosts.com. Once the peer has joined, there are several messages a servant can send out:
		
			\begin{itemize}
				\item A peer sends a PING message to it's neighbours to announce it's presents. This message is forwarded to other peers and each peer sends a PONG message back.
				\item The peer can issue QUERY answers. Other peers responds with a QUERY RESPONSE message to specify whether the file that was issued in the query, was found or not.
				\item To transfer items between peers, the GET and PUSH messages are being used.
			\end{itemize}
			
			Gnutella is an unstructured network which means that the placement of data items is not based on any knowledge of the topology nor the contents of the file. To search for a file, a flooding algorithm is used.
		
		\subsection{Freenet}
			In Freenet, each data item is represented by a key that is independent of the location of the file. Freenet is called a loosely structured network because of this. To issue a query, the request is passed from client to client where each client makes a decision about the location to send the request next.
		
			There are three types of file keys in Freenet: the first one is called the Keyword-Signed Key (KSK) which is derived from a short description of the file. Another key is the Signed-Subspace key (SSK) which enables personal namespaces. This key contains a public key and a private key where the private key is used to store the data and the public key is used in the queries of the file. The third type of key is the Content-Hash Key (CHK) which is used for updating and splitting of contents.
		
			The routing algorithm for storing and retrieving data is dynamically and can adjust to the topology of the network. Each peer has only knowledge about his neighbours. Each request has a Hops-To-Live timer which indicates how many peers the request may traversal. Each peer decrements the timer by one and when the timer reaches zero, the request isn't forwarded any more. Results of queries are being cached in intermediate nodes to reduce the time for a query response. To prevent looping of the requests, each request contains a random identifier. The peers the request travels through, keep track of these identifiers and rejects the request if the request has already been answered by the peer.

	\section{Comparison existing decentralized  networks}
Many other decentralized peer-to-peer networks have been proposed and some have been implemented [linkjes naar papers]. Examples of fully decentralized networks are Gnutella, Freenet, Freehaven, Tapestry, Kademlia and Tarzan. Each of these decentralized networks will be discussed in the next section. Note that we're only considering fully decentralized networks here. Networks that are partially or hybrid centralized, such as KaZaA and Napster, are not discussed here.[link naar survey p2p?]

		\subsection{Pastry}
			Information about Pastry.
		

		\subsection{Tapestry}
			Tapestry is based on the Plaxton mesh data structure [linkje naar plaxton paper], which maintains pointers to node in the network whose IDs match the elements of a tree-like structure of ID prefixes up to a digit position. A property of Tapestry is that it offers load distribution and routing locality. Tapastry is very similar to pastry [link naar pastry paper] but there are some small differences in in the handling of network locality and data replication.
		
			Like Gnutella, peers can take the role of a client, issuing requests and the role of a server where objects are stored. A peer can also function as a router, which forwards an incoming message. The routing algorithm is based on the destination ID of the packet. Routers are using local routing maps to route messages to the destination ID digit by digit. The routing system ensures that each peer in the system can be found in a logarithmic amount of hops.
		
			Tapestry is a fundamental component of Oceanstore [linkje naar paper over Oceanstore], a decentralized storage system. Tapestry is also used in systems such as Bayeux and SpamWatch, a decentralized spam-filtering system.
		
		\subsection{Tarzan}
			Information about Tarzan.
		
		\subsection{Other decentralized systems}
			Some other decentralized peer-to-peer systems has been developed, focussing on anonymity. An example of such a system is AP3 (Anonymizing Peer-to-Peer Proxy) [linkje naar AP3 paper] which makes cooperative, decentralized anonymous communication possible. The AP3 system provides clients with three primitives: anonymous message delivery, anonymous channels and secure pseudonyms. Users are able to send and receive unicast, multicast and anycast messages anonymously. The strategy that AP3 is using for message delivery is similar to that of Tarzan: it relies on a network of peers to forward messages. A node along the request path, does not know whether the node from which it receives a message is the message's originator or simply another forwarding peer.
	
	\section{Comparison existing decentralized networks}
		
		In the last section, we discussedexisting decentralized peer-to-peer networks. In this section we will make a comparison between these networks. For each network, we will explain the following features:
\begin{itemize}
\item Compatibility with Tor. If the network is compatible with Tor, the network or some features of the network could be used for the decentralization of Tor.
\item Public implementation. For each network we will explain whether a public implementation is available.
\item Used in practice. Is the network used in practice?
\item Attack resistance. We will explain the various weaknesses and possible attacks of each network.
\end{itemize}
	
	\section{Conclusion}
		In this technical report we introduced Tor and explained how Tor works and which components define a Tor network. Furthermore we looked at the main disadvantages and problems Tor currently has. We then made a bridge to decentralized systems. We first explained which problems one might face when decentralizing a system such as Tor. The next section shows which systems currently have a decentralized structure and/or mechanism. These systems are then compared to each other with their pros and cons.\\
		
		From this table we come to the conclusion that there is no complete decentralized system that provides the full functionality and security that Tor offers today. While there is a lot of research on decentralized systems, there is not a system yet that can compete with Tor. The systems that do exist such as Tarzan, Torsk and Gnutella are getting things right, yet they often lack functionality such as anonymity, good routing performance or are vulnerable for a variety of  attacks.\\
		
While Tor also still has a lot to improve on, further research and development is needed to improve the current decentralized systems and develop a decentralized system that matches Tor's current standards.
